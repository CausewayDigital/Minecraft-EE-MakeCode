## Task Complete @showdialog
### Agent Licence

Great job! I am happy to award an **Agent Licence** to you.

You might find this useful if you want to help out other folks on the island, as it proves you know how to use your Agent.

## Whistle @showdialog

![Whistle](whistle_small.jpg)   

You have also now been given a **Whistle**.

If you **right click** while holding it in your hand, it will **call your agent** to you, from wherever it might be in the world.

Oh and, if you ever lose your whistle, come back and see me.
