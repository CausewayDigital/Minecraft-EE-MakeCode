# Python Islands 1 - Whistle

## Task Complete @showdialog
### Agent Licence

Great job! I am happy to award an **Agent Licence** to you.

You might find this useful if you want to help out other folks on the island, as it proves you know how to use your Agent.

You have also now been given a **Whistle**.

If you **right click** while holding it in your hand, it will **call your agent** to you, from wherever it might be in the world.

Oh and, if you ever lose your whistle, come back and see me.
