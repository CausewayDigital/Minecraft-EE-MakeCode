# Bed Bouncer

## Introduction @showdialog
Don't you love bouncing on a bed and making a mess? Following the program flowchart below, create a Python program that:

- Check if player is bouncing above a bed, if so
    - Apply Levitation
    - Apply Regeneration

Follow the flowchart bellow:

## Part 1

![Cover image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CausewayDigital/Minecraft-EE-MakeCode/refs/heads/master/tutorials/python-islands/island-7/bed_bouncer/images/Part_1.png)

Code the flowchart.

```python
```
Create a function that is called when the player `BOUNCE`'s.

## Part 2

(for levitation use a duration of 2 and an amplifier of 1)

Code the flowchart.

```python
blocks.test_for_block(BED, player.position())
mobs.apply_effect(LEVITATION, mobs.target(NEAREST_PLAYER), 2, 1)
```

```ghost
def on_jump():
    if blocks.test_for_block(BED, player.position()):
        mobs.apply_effect(LEVITATION, mobs.target(NEAREST_PLAYER), 2, 1)
        mobs.apply_effect(REGENERATION, mobs.target(NEAREST_PLAYER), 3, 2)

player.on_travelled(BOUNCE, on_jump)
```

If the player is jumping on a bed, apply `LEVITATION` to the player.

See above for some useful code.

## Part 3

(for regeneration use a duration of 3 and an amplifier of 2)

Code the flowchart.

```python
```
Within the if statement, apply `REGENERATION` to the player.
