# Seymour Island

## Seymour Island @unplugged

Welcome to Seymour Island. To earn your place on the island, you must go and help 
out the locals. The tasks are spread across the island (and below it in the mine).  
If you want to check how you are getting on with completing all the tasks, drop
by the progress checker on the ground floor of the town hall.

## Task difficulties @unplugged

There are a large collection of different tasks for you to complete.
Each of these tasks has a difficulty assigned to it, ranging from easy (green) to intermediate (orange) to advanced (red).     
To give a task a go, follow the coloured route on the ground and talk to the NPC at the entrance of the task.

## Personal Phone @unplugged

When working through a task, if you want to reset the task, the location of your agent or quit the task early, you can use your phone.
You will find the phone in your inventory.
