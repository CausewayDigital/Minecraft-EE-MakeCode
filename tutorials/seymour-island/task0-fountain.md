# Seymour Island

## Seymour Island @unplugged

Welcome to Seymour Island. To earn your place on the island, you must go and help 
out the locals. The tasks are spread across the island (and below it in the mine).  
If you want to check how you are getting on with completing all the tasks, drop
by the progress checker on the ground floor of the town hall.

## Status @unplugged

There are a large collection of different tasks for you to complete.     
Want to try a particular task?    
Make sure the status displays at the front are green. If they are
red, someone else is using it right now.   
   
Most tasks are duplicated 2-3 times, so if one is busy, why not try the next one?

## Buttons @unplugged

Keep an eye out in each task for these buttons. They allow you to 
- Quit the task to go try a different task.
- Reset your agent (only) back to its starting position.
- Reset the full task completely (except for the code you have written).

## Mayor @unplugged

Looks like the Mayor is up ahead, you should go talk to her, perhaps she can help answer some questions you might have?
