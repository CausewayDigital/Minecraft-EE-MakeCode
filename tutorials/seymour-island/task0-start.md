## Agent @unplugged

This is an Agent. The Agent is a little robot that can be programmed to complete tasks within Minecraft. It can move, place blocks and even break blocks.

## Get started @unplugged

Let's get you started on training using your new Agent. First, lets try writing
some code to instruct it to move from the Diamond block to the Gold block.

You may wish to close this window (hit the **esc** key) to find your agent.   
Remember, you can open it up again by pressing **C**

## Time to code
Drag out an ``||Agent:agent move||`` block into the ``||loops:on start||`` block.   
You will then need to change the **forward** to **left**.   
You might also need to change the number of steps...   

When you are ready to run your code, click the **play** button in the bottom right.

```blocks
    agent.move(LEFT, 2)
```

```package
seymour=github:CausewayDigital/Minecraft-EE-MakeCode
```
